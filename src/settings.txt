Remember: only *change* numbers, do not add or remove them. 
These settings are fail-safe settings.
You might want to change it in certain circumstances.
AND DO NOT write 'Zero' or 'One'! Insert instead the actual number ;-).
(yes, I know, I should work over the file input algorithm :} )
Oh and please do not hesitate to ask me questions, I will put them in the FAQ :)

---------------
Input / Output:
---------------

Colors 1
-- You might want to turn this to 'Zero' if your screen does not support
-- colors.

Detailed Output 1
-- a 'One' means that the build order in the output file 'bo_*.txt' will be
-- printed with a timestamp [min:sec] in front of each order.
-- a 'Zero' will result in a compact view of the build order which is probably
-- much more readable

Line correction 0
-- Some consoles have an additional line (twenty five instead of twenty four).
-- If you set this to 'Zero' it looks better in some consoles (like the
-- standard linux text console)

Gizmo 1
-- That scrolling text at the top and at the bottom :)
-- Just set it to 'Zero' if you are sick of it ;-)
-- I will work over the text in the next version

------------
Map Options:
------------

Time to Enemy 0
-- This is the time in seconds a 'normal' unit will need to reach the base of
-- the enemy. This setting is especially useful when trying a rush.
-- SCC will adjust the time to each unit as the speed is different.
-- I will add here another setting for air units later.
-- A zero will switch this option off.
-- WARNING: IF YOU SET BOTH 'Time to Enemy' AND THE TIMES FOR UNITS IN THE 
-- 'goal_*.txt' FILES, RETHINK WHETHER THIS GOALS ARE POSSIBLE...
-- example: 'Time to Enemy' is set to ninty while two zealots are set 
-- to five minutes: ninty seconds (ToT) + eighty (two zealots) + thirty
-- (pylon) + sixty (gateway) = ~four minutes... Theoretically enough
-- but you also have to gather minerals. The calculation will end in 
-- a weird result... :[

Vespine Geysirs 1
-- This setting describes how many Vespine Geysirs are near the main base.
-- As there are no rules for an expansion in the calculator this really
-- only means how many of them are near your starting position.

Mineral Gathering modificator 100 
-- Well... I still have a hard time to figure out how much a drone/scv/probe
-- really gathers. I did some tests, stopped the time etc. I think the
-- relations between the number of gatherers is more or less correct.
-- Primarily this describes the distance CC/Nexus/Hatch to the Mineral blocks

Mineral Blocks 8
-- If there are more workers than blocks then some workers have to wait.
-- i.e. if you set Mineral blocks to for example sixteen every single worker
-- will gather the same amount of minerals / minute no matter whether you have
-- four, eight or sixteen.

Time to wallin 0 *not yet implemented*
-- Should defensive buildings be placed away from the main building?
-- This result in higher delays as the drone has to reach the building site
-- first.
-- A 'Zero' deactivates this function.

Scout Time 0
-- At which time a probe / scv should be dispatched to scout the enemy.
-- In program mechanics this means: This probe/scv is lost after 'Scout Time'
-- seconds. Set it to 'Zero' to deactivate it.
-- It is deactivated for the Zerg.
-- Note: The scout probe still needs supply and it is not mentioned in the
-- build order directly

-----------------
Internal Options:
-----------------

Max Time 30 (in minutes)
-- Max Time is to define the search space at the beginning.
-- That means: The program will run slow at the beginning when using a high
-- value and visa versa it will run fast at the beginning when using a small
-- value. 
-- Besides that a high value will grant that the program will find a basic 
-- solution (which fulfills the goals stated in goals_*.txt)
-- A good thumb rule: Set it to thrice the value you would need to build it.

Max Generations 50
-- Max Generations define the time how long a build order should be optimized.
-- After *Max Generations* Generations without change in time and gathered
-- resources, the current run will end and saved.

Mutations 50 
-- How many items in a build order of each test case should have the chance to
-- mutate? Very small values will result in a slow evolution where only small
-- changes per step are possible. It might remain in a local optima :/
-- On the other side very large values will result mainly in destructive
-- mutations which will slow down evolution too... 
-- Fifty worked quite well though there is probably a better number depending
-- on the task

Mutation Rate 150
-- Mutation rate is the probability of a change in the build order.
-- In contrary to above, a large value means that there is a low probability
-- of a mutation and visa versa a small value will result in a high
-- probability.

Verbose Messages 1
-- You probably want to let this at its default setting...
-- Setting it to 'Zero' will cause the program to just output the file and
-- that's about it. NO Debug messages etc.
